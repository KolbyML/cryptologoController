# cryptologoController

This is a program I wrote 2-3 years ago when I was running websites called NodeMarketCap and StakingReturns. I wrote this to convert images to different formats for a CDN for the websites. All the logos are on a different repo https://github.com/kolbydevgroup/cryptologo

Which was the host for the logos for over 2k different coins. I would have a script which would git pull changes from that repo to a nginx install on a server running ubuntu..
